I completely agree—positioning AI as a tool rather than a crutch is essential, especially in K-12 settings where students are still developing foundational skills in critical thinking and digital literacy. The misuse or overreliance on AI often stems not from malintent, but from a lack of structured guidance on how to engage with AI thoughtfully and responsibly.To help students understand AI as a tool, I believe we need to embed AI literacy directly into the curriculum. This could include age-appropriate lessons on what AI is, how it works (in simplified terms), and what its limitations are.

iQuyx6S3xsz5bjvMj,,NS,Di3iwWPATxj4aGYkL,,"In this regard, another conceptualisation of AI can provide significant opportunities. AI canalso be conceptualised as computational models of complex learning phenomena for hu-mans to internalise and change their representation of thought (Kent et al., 2021). Theselead to relatively low automation systems that allow high human agency and control (see theAIED- HCD conceptual framework in Figure 2).In learning sciences literature, it is well established that learning may be facilitated withmental models (Johnson- Laird, 1983). Mental models help us explain and predict how peo-ple interact with the world, and how they explain, understand, solve anticipated events andcommunicate. While mental models are internal structures, they can be exteriorised whentriggered by interaction (Bransford et al., 2000). The assumption in this conceptualisation ofAI is that computational models can offer an externalisation trigger for mental models. Bythat, they can serve as a learning affordance, and the learning outcomes can be observedthrough changes in learners' language, and their ability to explain, predict or diagnose phe-nomena (Kent et al., 2021). So, although everyone comes to a learning situation with theirown mental model of what success looks like, as well as the models that learners hold aboutthemselves (Byrne, 1992), we can use data to model what success looks like with computa-tional approaches and present these models back to people and trigger them to refine theirmental models.This conceptualisation allows more opportunities for researchers interested in under-standing and designing learning environments through the lens of constructivist and socio-cultural learning perspectives. It allows opportunities to focus on AI models to help developlearner competence through rich learning experiences and reflecting on these experienceswith the help of computational models","It reimagines AI not as a tool of automation but as a cognitive partner that models complex learning phenomena to support the development and refinement of learners’ mental models. It encourages the design of low-automation, high-agency systems that foster metacognition and learner autonomy. This perspective invites rich pedagogical and ethical questions: How can AI be designed to prompt meaningful self-explanation and conceptual change? What kinds of data or language patterns best indicate a transformation in thinking? How can we ensure that such systems are accessible and culturally responsive, reflecting diverse ways of knowing rather than imposing narrow models of success? Finally, what role should teachers play in mediating student interactions with AI and interpreting computational representations of learning?

It becomes more and more complicated because they increased to the point to reproduce almost everything perfectly, humans included. AI is now able to generate images, photographs, graphic design, illustration, poetry, essays, songs, etc as well as most artists. It is able to give you advice about law and legal procedure to the point to lawyers or legal advisers are feeling threatened. It is able to simulate a social interaction with a friend or a confident, reproduce human emotion or dialogue when you are in trouble, and simulate compassion and attention to the point where people are preferring virtual AI partners over real ones, or are using AI as a therapist.

In my experience, the teacher circulated between groups and try to help them one by one, and it can lead to encouraging the other groups that are not being observed by the teacher to be distracted or to talk about other things (or switch to their native language in language classes, for example). I guess that those kind of ""tracking"" AI tools could encourage (force ?) students to stay on track and actively participate in group work rather than relying on others.

Do other students do not use the AI because they do not trust it or are there ulterior motives. Do they believe that the information they will get will be bad or do they not trust themselves to double check the information, think that it is more work that doing the process themselves. I know that here in education we talk about the information being wrong as it is s system that has enough information to put something together, however it does not go onto the internet and do the research. As people are afraid to use it responsibly then the process takes longer as the research does not have enough information to back it up. In order to make tweaks as needed there needs to be use and feedback with the systems. As researchers in AI want AI to be able to learn from itself it needs the data to know. Kind of like people we learn more from being wrong than right many times. When I teach and train this is a concept that I tell my trainees, and they seem to like that I tell them that up front.

AI canalso be conceptualised as computational models of complex learning phenomena for hu-mans to internalise and change their representation of thought (Kent etal.,2021). Theselead to relatively low automation systems that allow high human agency and control (see theAIED- HCD conceptual framework in Figure2).In learning sciences literature, it is well established that learning may be facilitated withmental models (Johnson- Laird,1983). Mental models help us explain and predict how peo-ple interact with the world, and how they explain, understand, solve anticipated events andcommunicate. While mental models are internal structures, they can be exteriorised whentriggered by interaction (Bransford etal.,2000). The assumption in this conceptualisation ofAI is that computational models can offer an externalisation trigger for mental models. Bythat, they can serve as a learning affordance, and the learning outcomes can be observedthrough changes in learners' language, and their ability to explain, predict or diagnose phe-nomena (Kent etal.,2021). So, although everyone comes to a learning situation with theirown mental model of what success looks like, as well as the models that learners hold aboutthemselves (Byrne,1992), we can use data to model what success looks like with computa-tional approaches and present these models back to people and trigger them to refine theirmental models.This conceptualisation allows more opportunities for researchers interested in under-standing and designing learning environments through the lens of constructivist and socio-cultural learning perspectives.
